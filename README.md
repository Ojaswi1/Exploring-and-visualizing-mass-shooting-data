See detailed instructions for this homework assignment [here](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/homework/explore-data/).

## Required packages

You should have the following packages installed:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(rcfss)
```

[`rcfss`](https://github.com/uc-cfss/rcfss) can be installed from GitHub using the command:

```r
if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("uc-cfss/rcfss")
```

## Assignment submission

Your assignment should be submitted as a R Markdown document. Make sure you've read the chapter on [R Markdown](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) so you understand how to properly use these files.

For your benefit, I have provided a starter R Markdown document. You should not need to modify the starter code, merely add on to it. In the [`demo`](demo/) folder I have included [a minimal example solution](demo/mass-shootings-solution.md). This file does not contain any of the code necessary to complete the homework, but does show you output from R for potential solutions. **Your solutions do not need to perfectly replicate these tables and graphs, but are a good starting point.**

Follow instructions on [homework workflow](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/faq/homework-guidelines/#homework-workflow) to submit your homework. As part of the pull request, you're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.
